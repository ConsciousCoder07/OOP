/*
In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

1. Compile-time polymorphism: 
It is also known as static polymorphism. 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. 
But Java doesnâ€™t support the Operator Overloading.

Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then 
these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in 
number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.

2. Runtime polymorphism: 
It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. 
It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.

Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
That base function is said to be overridden.
